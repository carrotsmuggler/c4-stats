- [ ] Correlate `contests.csv` with `findings.csv`
- [ ] Allow sorting by different metric for `gini-wardens` command
- [ ] Create a "regen-docs" command to regenerate the documentation.

## Ideas for commands

- `contests`. Lists the names an ids of all contests a warden participated in
- `stats`. The command we've currently got
- create a graph (distribution) of findings vs dollars earned.
